*   **User Content:** Data you enter into forms, text you type, or content you view on web pages.
*   **Analytics or Telemetry Data:** Information about your usage of the extension.

Since no data is ever collected, it cannot be sold, shared, or used for any purpose.

### 2. Permissions

The Extension may request certain browser permissions to function correctly. These permissions are used exclusively for the core functionality of the Extension as described in the extension's store listing. These permissions are **never** used to access, collect, or transmit your data.

### 3. Third-Party Services

The Extension does not use any third-party services, analytics, or advertising frameworks. Therefore, no data is shared with any third parties.
